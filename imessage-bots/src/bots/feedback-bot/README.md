## How Cross-Chat Insights Work

### Privacy Protection
1. **No Personal Information Shared**: Individual messages are never shared between chats
2. **Anonymized Patterns**: Only general themes are tracked (e.g., "payment_issues", "performance_issues")
3. **Hashed Chat IDs**: Chat GUIDs are hashed to prevent identification
4. **Aggregated Insights**: Only patterns that appear across multiple chats trigger probes

### Insight Generation Process
1. **Theme Detection**: Messages are analyzed to identify general themes
2. **Pattern Recognition**: When the same theme appears in multiple chats, it becomes an "insight"
3. **Cross-Chat Probes**: Generic questions about the theme are generated for other chats
4. **Concurrent Delivery**: Probes are sent to relevant chats simultaneously

### Example Flow
```
Chat A: "The payment system keeps failing"
‚Üí Theme: "payment_issues" detected

Chat B: Gets probe: "How do you handle payment-related problems?"
Chat C: Gets probe: "What's your typical flow when making payments?"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Linear Integration Issues

1. **Check API Key**: Ensure your Linear API key is valid and has the right permissions
2. **Test Connection**: Run `python test_linear.py` to verify connectivity
3. **Check Team Configuration**: Verify your team key is correct or let it auto-select
4. **Review Logs**: Check bot logs for detailed error messages
5. **Session Tracking**: Look for auto-triaging logs to see if sessions are being detected

### Common Issues

- **"No teams found"**: Check your Linear API key and permissions
- **"Team not found"**: Verify your `LINEAR_TEAM_KEY` setting
- **"GPT-4o formatting failed"**: Check your OpenAI API key and quota
- **"Session not auto-triaging"**: Check `AUTO_TRIAGE_ON_SESSION_END` setting
- **"No feedback items found"**: Ensure users are providing actual feedback (not just questions)

### Auto-Triaging Debug

If automatic triaging isn't working:

1. **Check Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure these are set to true
   ENABLE_LINEAR_INTEGRATION=true
   AUTO_TRIAGE_ON_SESSION_END=true
   ```

2. **Monitor Logs**: Look for these log patterns:
   ```bash
   # Session ending detection
   üéØ Feedback session ending for chat...
   
   # Feedback collection
   üìä Chat session ... feedback summary
   
   # Issue creation
   ‚úÖ Created Linear issue for chat session...
   ```

3. **Test Manually**: Use the manual endpoints to verify Linear connectivity
